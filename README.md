# Remember this

You need NodeJS installed to use this: https://nodejs.org/en

To deploy you also need the Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools` 

# Useful commands

- `npm start` Runs a development server on localhost
- `npm run build` Builds all the files into the src directory
- `firebase login` Login to the firebase CLI so we can deploy to prod
- `firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview_name` deploy to a preview channel (background map will not work)
- `firebase deploy` deploy to prod

# Remember this
- To enable succesfull linkthroughs (a.k.a. from */nvo to */nvo.html, edit the firebase.json file)
